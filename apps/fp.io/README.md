As I am primarily focused in Functional Programming my dev website will also be focused in Functional Programming. FP itself, the things I learn as I learn them and whatever else I feel would be informative to others. 

## Current website
- Website: https://mrpotatoes.github.io/functional-programming-in-js-reference/#/
- Website Repo: https://github.com/mrpotatoes/functional-programming-in-js-reference

My plans are to use Next.js (at least for now) and moving everything over.

## New potential themes
- [https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v44.0.0/sdk/admob/](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v44.0.0/sdk/admob/)
- [https://github.com/lwz7512/next-smooth-doc](https://github.com/lwz7512/next-smooth-doc)
