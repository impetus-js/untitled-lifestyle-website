# Recipe Schema
A new JSON schema specifically for food recipes. Meant to support food blogs, chefs[^1] and for me Food Labs.

I like to do food labs which has more complex requirements and partials are an important part of that. 

## Work in progress
I'm back at it, finally. 

## Trying it out
1. clone → `git clone https://github.com/mrpotatoes/untitled-lifestyle-website.git`
1. install → `npm i`
1. run → `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
1. view → `__recipe-schema.yaml` or `__recipe-schema.json`
